I made 3 watermarks cuz I'm pretty bored at night(and it's been a while since I use PS so I want to get used to the tools again).
I dunno which one is the best so I just choose 1 watermark randomly to put on my pict and put the rest at Watermark.jpg
I also upload the .psd file

Picture was taken at Comic Frontier 12(some weeaboo/jejepangan event).
I choose Back to Reality as the title since it was taken when the event ended and ppl are going back to home,
the ride is over and it's time to get back to reality.
